# Scruffing VR
Fork of the original Parcour VR for the IARVR project. As the .apk file is to big to upload to github a compiled version is uploaded to my own cloud and can be found here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au2JnrK0JCCTm60nkZ5vsc8pScGGeA?e=wyMuWr
It is built for teh Quest 2 and may be usable on the Quest 3 as well, but has not been tested for it yet!
